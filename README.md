# CRIMP
### A real-time scoring app for climbing events

CRIMP is an open-source real-time scoring app first released in 2014. We are the first ever scoring app for climbing events, specially made to improve the experience at climbing events.

From 2014-2016, the app was used by climbing club in National University of Singapore to run their annual competition, the [NUS - Black Diamond Boulderactive](http://boulderactive.nusclimb.com/). We had 3 successful years, and learnt a great deal from running the app on events with 700+ climbers.

We wanted the app to be used by every climbing event out there, so we released *everything* for free. After 3 years with a few other events trying to use it, it became clear to us that it was difficult for a layman to deploy the entire tech-stack by themselves. The open-source model was not the best approach if we want folks to use CRIMP.

We want to try to run CRIMP as a paid service. The money would support development (paying for more developers/designers, better servers) and let us provide adequate support to events running the app.

The source code for future iterations will not be published. We have made quite a bit of improvements and changes to CRIMP since, but the source code until June 2016 is still open-source for reference and you can find them [here](https://github.com/leedongwei/CRIMP/releases) and [here](https://github.com/leedongwei/CRIMP/commits/master).

If you're a climber, we hope to bring CRIMP to a climbing event near you! If you're an event organizer and would like to use the app for your event, please take a look at [our website](http://crimp.rocks) or drop me an email at dw@crimp.rocks for more info.

Cheers!
